    "To do this we can use the `sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder` package  \n",
    "When adjusting, we have to remember we need the columns to represent numerical data, when changing this we need encode. However we don't want to confuse our ML model by it thinking that one label is greater than another, therefore we use `OneHotEncoder`. Using `OneHotEncoder` we will replace the target column with multiple columns responding to the category label. Each column will be filled with 0s and 1s, thus eliminating competing values attributiion, a.k.a *dummy variables*.  \n",

    "### Spliting Dataset  \n",
    "Why do we split the data? To avoid **overfitting**. So we make a training set and a test set. Convention is to use 20% for test."
